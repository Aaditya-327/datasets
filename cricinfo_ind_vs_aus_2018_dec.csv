55.6,"Virat Kohli at the moment can run through the stone wall for his team. He is carrying the weight of a nation on his shoulder formidably well. But battles aren't won by a single individual, he needs the rest of the troops to show fight and character too. It?s high time, he and his think-tank sitting in the dressing room get their team combinations right after looking at the 22 yards. That's it from all of us for the coverage of this debut Test match at this venue. We can trust the traditional Boxing Day Test at the MCG to be as thrilling as the first two matches have been and you can trust us to bring you the best coverage.

Pat Cummins looks to stand up to the short of length ball but the ball keeps perilously low for the woodwork to be shattered. Pat Cummins had no chance.
